## ReplicaSet Practice — 6/7/2025

Spent time getting more fluent with `kubectl` — especially around inspecting resources and managing workloads. Starting to handwrite ReplicaSet manifests now, and the workflow feels way more natural.

Also began converting older `docker-compose` YAMLs into proper Kubernetes `Deployment` and `Service` manifests. Things that felt abstract before (like selectors, labels, and service routing) are starting to click.

For my text editor, I fully migrated from VS Code to NeoVim.
